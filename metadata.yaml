description: In order to ease my conscience and, further, to disclose certain facts
  which for the past year or two have, I know, greatly puzzled readers of our daily
  newspapers, I have decided to here reveal some very curious and, perhaps, sensational
  circumstances. In fact, after much perplexity and long consideration, I have resolved,
  without seeking grace or favor, to make a clean breast of all that happened to me,
  and to leave the reader to judge of my actions, and either to condemn or to condone
  my offenses. I will begin at the beginning. It has been said that service in the
  Army has upset.
